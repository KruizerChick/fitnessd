## Course Summary

Building data-driven web apps is tough. Yes, Python makes it easier than most languages, but you need to know a host of different languages and technologies and they have to fit together just right. This usually includes Python, HTML, CSS, SQL, Linux, a database server, and maybe even JavaScript. But with Anvil, you can create full stack, data-driven web apps with only Python. You write Python on the backend and Python on the client-side. The HTML and CSS are handled with Anvil's drag-and-drop visual editor. The database is seamlessly connected back to your application. And this is the course to teach you how to be effective with Anvil and Python to build data-driven web applications.
